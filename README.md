# Bankruptcy-Prediction-project-
The primary objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a business becoming bankrupt based on several distinct features. Since the target variable is binary (bankruptcy/non-bankruptcy), the model will be trained to estimate the probability of bankruptcy from the given set of features.
